==ABOUT==
This is the WordPress theme to be used in conjunction with the Pete Schuster BoilerPlate Template.

Pete Schuster Boiler Plate is a basic HTML/CSS siteskeleton that can be used to develop sites quickly and with a standardize codebase.


==THE GOAL==

The goal of this boilerplate is to aggregate all best practices and boilerplates from across the web, and condense/refine them into once place.


==WORDPRESS USAGE==

I typically start a WordPress build locally outside of the theme. Then once I get the majority of my front end built, I copy the "images" "css" and "js" folders into the "theme" directory. After that, I usually edit the header, footer, and sidebar files as need per the design.
